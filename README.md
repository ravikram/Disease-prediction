<h3 align="center">Disease Prediction using Machine Learning (ML)</h3>

This project dives into the exciting area of disease prediction using machine learning. I used my skills in working with data, building models, and checking their performance to create a reliable system.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
 - Data Wrangling: Adeptly handled data preparation tasks including:
 - Importing and Cleaning: Flawlessly loaded the dataset using pandas, meticulously addressing missing values.
 - Balancing Assessment: Employed visualization techniques to assess and confirm balanced data distribution, crucial for model accuracy.
 - Encoding: Expertly transformed categorical target variables into numerical form using a Label Encoder for seamless model integration.

**Model Building and Selection:**
 - K-Fold Cross-Validation: Employed this robust technique to evaluate the performance of various models on unseen data, ensuring generalizability.
 - Multi-Model Approach: Confidently implemented and compared three well-regarded algorithms: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Random Forest Classifier.
 - Performance Analysis: Demonstrated a deep understanding of evaluation metrics, going beyond just accuracy to consider precision, recall, and F1-score for a comprehensive assessment.

**Technical Proficiency:**
 - Python Libraries: Effectively utilized industry-standard libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, model development, visualization, and insightful exploration.
 - Jupyter Notebook: Employed Jupyter Notebook as the primary development environment, fostering efficient code execution, experimentation, and clear presentation of results.

**Project Highlights:**
 - Exceptional Model Performance: Achieved remarkable accuracy (100%) on test data using the combined model, showcasing the effectiveness of the implemented approach.
 - Combining Model Strengths: Leveraged the power of ensemble learning by combining predictions from multiple models, resulting in a more robust and reliable prediction system.
 - Interactive Function Creation: Constructed a user-friendly function that takes comma-separated symptom inputs and generates disease predictions using the trained models, offering real-world applicability.

**Impact and Future:**<br>
This project significantly bolstered my confidence in tackling complex machine learning challenges. The acquired knowledge and skills empower me to delve deeper into medical diagnosis prediction systems, potentially contributing to advancements in healthcare and early disease detection.
